# ReverseShells
Some reverse shells I coded back in the day.<br>
This originally originated from my messanger-project back in 2021, where I could send messages over my wifi to two seperate computers.<br>
I then "improved" this project to also be able to control the other computer, resulting in the ReverseShell1. <br>
Later, I also added support for a connection through TOR, making the ReverShell2 able to connect to any computer outside of my home-netwok.<br>
ReverseShell3 sadly I never finished.
