# ReverseShells
Some reverse shells I coded back in the day.
This originally originated from my messanger-project back in 2021, where I could send messages over my wifi to two seperate computers.
I then "improved" this project to also be able to control the other computer, resulting in the ReverseShell1 and so on and so forth.
